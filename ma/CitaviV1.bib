@article{Yang.2021,
 abstract = {Summary

As exemplified by the extreme cold weather hitting central China and causing great economic losses in 2018, as well as the 2021 Texas power crisis involving more than 4.5 million homes and businesses in the United States owing to frosting/icing, anti-frosting/anti-icing has been a long-standing challenge in modern society. Over the past decade, various approaches have been used to achieve anti-frosting, including active approaches and passive approaches. Given that active anti-frosting strategies are inefficient, energy consuming, and ponderous, tremendous progress has been made for passive anti-frosting strategies, owing to the booming of material engineering and the advanced measuring approaches. This review focuses on the process of condensation frosting, progress on passive anti-frosting, and prospects for this field. We aim to bring a comprehensive framework on passive anti-frosting in the broad sense: from inhibition of ice nucleation to reduction of frost/ice adhesion, from nanoscale to millimeter scale, and from surface design to material selection.},

@article{Wu.2015,
 abstract = {In the present study dynamic behavior of distilled water ice (polycrystalline ice Ih) is investigated under uniaxial compression at strain rates in the range of 100~s$-$~1 to 1350~s$-$~1 and at temperatures in the range of $-$~15~°C to $-$~173~°C using a modified split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The peak compressive strength is found to increase from 32~MPa to 112~MPa as the test temperatures are decreased from $-$~15~°C to $-$~125~°C. With a further decrease in test temperature from $-$~125~°C to $-$~173~°C the peak strength is observed to remain nearly constant and lie in the range of 110--120~MPa. In addition, the ice samples show positive strain rate sensitivity over the range of strain rates employed in the present tests at test temperatures in the range of $-$~15~°C to $-$~125~°C. However, the sensitivity of the logarithmic of peak stress (strength) to logarithmic of strain rate decreases with decreasing test temperatures, and the ice samples are observed to be nearly insensitive to strain rate at test temperatures lower than $-$~125~°C. An interesting feature of the dynamic compressive behavior of ice is the presence of a shoulder/double-peak in the dynamic stress versus strain curves at test temperatures in the range of $-$~50~°C to $-$~150~°C. Another feature of the post-peak stress regime of distilled water ice is the presence of a long tail in the dynamic stress versus strain curves at a test temperature of $-$~15~°C. At lower test temperatures (from $-$~150~°C to $-$~173~°C) the residual strength of ice is observed to become negligible. These artifacts in the dynamic behavior of ice can be attributed to details associated with dynamic failure of the ice samples and geometric effects emanating from the finite size of the samples and the diameter of the loading bars. The residual dynamic strength of ice can be best understood by considering the damaged/fragmented ice as an assemblage of wet highly-fragmented granular material created by adiabatic heating during grain-to-grain frictional sliding and held together by ice melt and/or recrystallization in the post peak-stress regime.},

@article{Mertens.2016,
 abstract = {When a gecko moves on a ceiling it makes use of adhesion and stiction. Stiction--static friction--is experienced on microscopic and macroscopic scales and is related to adhesion and sliding friction. Although important for most locomotive processes, the concepts of adhesion, stiction and sliding friction are often only empirically correlated. A more detailed understanding of these concepts will, for example, help to improve the design of increasingly smaller devices such as micro- and nanoelectromechanical switches. Here we show how stiction and adhesion are related for a liquid drop on a hexagonal boron nitride monolayer on rhodium, by measuring dynamic contact angles in two distinct states of the solid-liquid interface: a corrugated state in the absence of hydrogen intercalation and an intercalation-induced flat state. Stiction and adhesion can be reversibly switched by applying different electrochemical potentials to the sample, causing atomic hydrogen to be intercalated or not. We ascribe the change in adhesion to a change in lateral electric field of in-plane two-nanometre dipole rings, because it cannot be explained by the change in surface roughness known from the Wenzel model. Although the change in adhesion can be calculated for the system we study, it is not yet possible to determine the stiction at such a solid-liquid interface using ab initio methods. The inorganic hybrid of hexagonal boron nitride and rhodium is very stable and represents a new class of switchable surfaces with the potential for application in the study of adhesion, friction and lubrication.},

 abstract = {Innovations in cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) have led to high-quality structures of important proteins such as the ribosome and \textgreek{g}-secretase, the membrane protease that produces A\textgreek{b} involved in Alzheimer's disease. However, freezing may change protein structure and dynamics relative to the physiologically relevant {\textquotedbl}hot{\textquotedbl} state. To explore this, we studied substrate-bound \textgreek{g}-secretase (6IYC) by molecular dynamics as a hot, cold, and quickly cooled state in both membrane and water systems. We show that the experimental structure resembles the simulated cooled state, structurally between the hot and cold states and membrane and water systems, but with cold dynamics. We observe {\textquotedbl}cryo-contraction{\textquotedbl} in the membrane from 303 to 85 K, reducing radius of gyration (Rg) by 1{\%} from 4.01 to 3.97 nm (6IYC = 3.95 nm). The hot state features an unwound C83-substrate with 10-14 \textgreek{a}-helix residues (6IYC: 11) in equilibrium with an intact state with 16 helix residues not previously reported. The \textgreek{b}-sheet is weakened with temperature. Multiple hot conformations probably control the A\textgreek{b}42/A\textgreek{b}40 ratio. We thus propose that MD simulation protocols of hot, cold, and cooled states as applied here can correct cryo-EM coordinates. However, important frozen-out fast modes require specific supplementary hot simulations or experiments.},

@article{Kurniawan.2018,
 abstract = {The structure, phase behavior, and properties of cellular membranes are derived from their composition, which includes phospholipids, sphingolipids, sterols, and proteins with various levels of glycosylation. Because of the intricate nature of cellular membranes, a plethora of in vitro studies have been carried out with model membrane systems that capture particular properties such as fluidity, permeability, and protein binding but vastly simplify the membrane composition in order to focus in detail on a specialized property or function. Supported lipid bilayers (SLB) are widely used as archetypes for cellular membranes, and this instructional review primarily focuses on the preparation and characterization of SLB systems formed by Langmuir deposition methods. Typical characterization methods, which take advantage of the planar orientation of SLBs, are illustrated, and references that go into more depth are included. This invited instructional review is written so that nonexperts can quickly gain in-depth knowledge regarding the preparation and characterization of SLBs. In addition, this work goes beyond traditional instructional reviews to provide expert readers with new results that cover a wider range of SLB systems than those previously reported in the literature. The quality of an SLB is frequently not well described, and details such as topological defects can influence the results and conclusions of an individual study. This article quantifies and compares the quality of SLBs fabricated from a variety of gel and fluid compositions, in correlation with preparation techniques and parameters, to generate general rules of thumb to guide the construction of designed SLB systems.},

@article{IbanezIbanez.2022,
 abstract = {HYPOTHESIS

Ice adhesion to rigid materials is reduced with low energy surfaces of high receding contact angles. However, their adhesion strength values are above the threshold value to be considered as icephobic materials. Surface deformability is a promising route to further reduce ice adhesion.

EXPERIMENTS

In this work, we prepared elastomer surfaces with a wide range of elastic moduli and hydrophobicity degree and we measured their ice adhesion strength. Moreover, we also explored the deicing performance of oil-infused elastomeric surfaces. The ice adhesion was characterized by two detachment modes: tensile and shear.

FINDINGS

The variety of elastomeric surfaces allowed us to simultaneously analyze the ice adhesion dependence with deformability and contact angle hysteresis. We found that the impact of these properties depends on the detachment mode, being deformability more important in shear mode and hydrophobicity more relevant in tensile mode. In addition, oil infusion further reduces ice adhesion due to the interfacial slippage. From an optimal balance between deformability and hydrophobicity, we were able to identify surfaces with super-low ice adhesion.},

@article{He.2018,
 abstract = {The mitigation of ice on exposed surfaces is of great importance to many aspects of life. Ice accretion, however, is unavoidable as time elapses and temperature lowers sufficiently. One practical solution is to reduce the ice adhesion strength on a surface to as low as possible, by either decreasing the substrate elastic modulus, lowering surface energy or increasing the length of cracks at the ice-solid interface. Herein, we present a facile preparation of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based sandwich-like sponges with super-low ice adhesion. The weight ratio of the PDMS prepolymer to the curing agent is tuned to a lower surface energy and elastic modulus. The introduction of PDMS sponge structures combined the advantages of both a reduced apparent elastic modulus and most importantly, the macroscopic crack initiators at the ice-solid interface, resulting in dramatic reduction of the ice adhesion strength. Our design of sandwich-like sponges achieved a low ice adhesion strength as low as 0.9 kPa for pure PDMS materials without any additives. The super-low ice adhesion strength remains constant after 25 icing and deicing cycles. We thus provide a new and low-cost approach to realize durable super-low ice adhesion surfaces.},

 abstract = {Preventing icing on exposed surfaces is important for life and technology. While suppressing ice nucleation by surface structuring and local confinement is highly desirable and yet to be achieved, a realistic roadmap of icephobicity is to live with ice, but with lowest possible ice adhesion. According to fracture mechanics, the key to lower ice adhesion is to maximize crack driving forces at the ice-substrate interface. Herein, we present a novel integrated macro-crack initiator mechanism combining nano-crack and micro-crack initiators, and demonstrate a new approach to designing super-low ice adhesion surfaces by introducing sub-structures into smooth polydimethylsiloxane coatings. Our design promotes the initiation of macro-cracks and enables the reduction of ice adhesion by at least $\sim$50{\%} regardless of the curing temperature, weight ratio and size of internal holes, reaching a lowest ice adhesion of 5.7 kPa. The multiscale crack initiator mechanisms provide an unprecedented and versatile strategy towards designing super-low ice adhesion surfaces.},

@article{Glatz.2018,
 abstract = {Controlled surface wrinkling is widely applied for structuring surfaces in the micro- and nano-range. The formation of cracks in the wrinkling process is however limiting applications, and developing approaches towards crack-free wrinkles is therefore vital. To understand crack-formation, we systematically characterized the thickness and mechanics of thin layers formed by O2-plasma-oxidation of polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) as a function of plasma power and pressure using Atomic Force Microscopy Quantitative Nano-mechanical Mapping (AFM-QNM). We found a nearly constant layer thickness with simultaneously changing Young's moduli for both power and pressure screenings. We determined the respective crack densities, revealing conditions for crack-free wrinkling. Thus we could identify correlations between the intensity of plasma treatment and the cracking behavior. The primary cause for crack-suppression is a continuous elasticity gradient starting within the soft bulk PDMS, and rising up to several hundred MPa at the oxidized layer's surface. With mechanical simulations via the Finite Elements Method (FEM) we were able to demonstrate a noticeable difference in maximal stress intensity \textgreek{s}max between a comparable, but theoretical single layer and a gradient interface. A threshold in tensile stress of \textgreek{s}crit = 14 MPa distinguishes between intact and cracked layers.},

To attain the highest level of resolution, aberration-free immersion objectives with accurately matched immersion media are required, but both do not exist for imaging below the glass-transition temperature of water. Here, we resolve this challenge by combining a cryoimmersion medium, HFE-7200, which matches the refractive index of room-temperature water, with a technological concept in which the body of the objective and the front lens are not in thermal equilibrium. We implemented this concept by replacing the metallic front-lens mount of a standard bioimaging water immersion objective with an insulating ceramic mount heated around its perimeter. In this way, the objective metal housing can be maintained at room temperature, while creating a thermally shielded cold microenvironment around the sample and front lens. To demonstrate the range of potential applications, we show that our method can provide superior contrast in Escherichia coli and yeast cells expressing fluorescent proteins and resolve submicrometer structures in multicolor immunolabeled human bone osteosarcoma epithelial (U2OS) cells at [Formula: see text]C.},

Electron-beam lithography, which makes 2D patterns down to a few nanometers, is one of the fundamental pillars of nanofabrication. Recently, significant progress in 3D electron-beam-based nanofabrication has been made, such as the emerging ice lithography technology, in which ice thin-films are patterned by a focused electron-beam. Here, we review the history and progress of ice lithography, and focus on its applications in efficient 3D nanofabrication and additive manufacturing or nanoscale 3D printing. The finest linewidth made using frozen octane is below 5 nm, and nanostructures can be fabricated in selected areas on non-planar surfaces such as freely suspended nanotubes or nanowires. As developing custom instruments is required to advance this emerging technology, we discuss the evolution of ice lithography instruments and highlight major instrumentation advances. Finally, we present the perspectives of 3D printing of functional materials using organic ices. We believe that we barely scratched the surface of this new and exciting research area, and we hope that this review will stimulate cutting-edge and interdisciplinary research that exploits the undiscovered potentials of ice lithography for 3D photonics, electronics and 3D nanodevices for biology and medicine.},
