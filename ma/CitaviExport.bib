 abstract = {Innovations in cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) have led to high-quality structures of important proteins such as the ribosome and \textgreek{g}-secretase, the membrane protease that produces A\textgreek{b} involved in Alzheimer's disease. However, freezing may change protein structure and dynamics relative to the physiologically relevant {\textquotedbl}hot{\textquotedbl} state. To explore this, we studied substrate-bound \textgreek{g}-secretase (6IYC) by molecular dynamics as a hot, cold, and quickly cooled state in both membrane and water systems. We show that the experimental structure resembles the simulated cooled state, structurally between the hot and cold states and membrane and water systems, but with cold dynamics. We observe {\textquotedbl}cryo-contraction{\textquotedbl} in the membrane from 303 to 85 K, reducing radius of gyration (Rg) by 1{\%} from 4.01 to 3.97 nm (6IYC = 3.95 nm). The hot state features an unwound C83-substrate with 10-14 \textgreek{a}-helix residues (6IYC: 11) in equilibrium with an intact state with 16 helix residues not previously reported. The \textgreek{b}-sheet is weakened with temperature. Multiple hot conformations probably control the A\textgreek{b}42/A\textgreek{b}40 ratio. We thus propose that MD simulation protocols of hot, cold, and cooled states as applied here can correct cryo-EM coordinates. However, important frozen-out fast modes require specific supplementary hot simulations or experiments.},

@article{Mertens.2016,
 abstract = {When a gecko moves on a ceiling it makes use of adhesion and stiction. Stiction--static friction--is experienced on microscopic and macroscopic scales and is related to adhesion and sliding friction. Although important for most locomotive processes, the concepts of adhesion, stiction and sliding friction are often only empirically correlated. A more detailed understanding of these concepts will, for example, help to improve the design of increasingly smaller devices such as micro- and nanoelectromechanical switches. Here we show how stiction and adhesion are related for a liquid drop on a hexagonal boron nitride monolayer on rhodium, by measuring dynamic contact angles in two distinct states of the solid-liquid interface: a corrugated state in the absence of hydrogen intercalation and an intercalation-induced flat state. Stiction and adhesion can be reversibly switched by applying different electrochemical potentials to the sample, causing atomic hydrogen to be intercalated or not. We ascribe the change in adhesion to a change in lateral electric field of in-plane two-nanometre dipole rings, because it cannot be explained by the change in surface roughness known from the Wenzel model. Although the change in adhesion can be calculated for the system we study, it is not yet possible to determine the stiction at such a solid-liquid interface using ab initio methods. The inorganic hybrid of hexagonal boron nitride and rhodium is very stable and represents a new class of switchable surfaces with the potential for application in the study of adhesion, friction and lubrication.},

 abstract = {The fundamental importance of lipids in membrane structure was established early in this century by demonstrations that positive correlations exist between cell membrane permeabilities to small nonelectrolytes and the oil/water partition coefficients of these molecules. Contemporary measurements of the electrical impedance of cell suspensions suggested that cells are surrounded by a hydrocarbon barrier, which was first estimated to be about 3.3 nm thick. It was originally thought that a membrane containing a lipid monolayer could account for these data. However, subsequent experiments established that the ratio of the area of a monolayer formed from erythrocyte membrane lipids to the surface area of these cells is nearly 2. These and other studies of the physical chemistry of lipids fortified the concept that a continuous lipid bilayer is a major component of cell membranes. This concept has received support from many other studies, including the interpretation of X-ray diffraction data obtained from intact cell membranes.},

However, cryo-EM is still a rapidly growing field, with unique challenges. Here, we summarise considerations for imaging of a range of specimens from macromolecular complexes to cells using EM.},

 abstract = {Rapid progress in micro- and nanotechnologies such as lab-on-a-chip (microfluidic networks, sensors, actuators, and connectors), soft lithography (replica moulding, microcontact printing and affinity contact printing), and stretchable transparent electronics has strongly benefitted from high-performance polymers like poly(dimethyl)siloxane (PDMS) that are suited for high-fidelity microsystem construction and rapid prototyping. While basic PDMS has been a unique enabling material, recent progress in tailoring PDMS to specific requirements will render this material even more valuable in the future.

Basic PDMS is elastic, transparent, biocompatible, gas-permeable, and forms conformal contact with surfaces.

Surface modifications of PDMS, inducing properties such as hydrophilicity, electrical conductivity, anti-fouling, energy harvesting, and energy storage (supercapacitors) are of major interest.

Bulk modifications can alter PDMS properties such as elasticity, electrical and thermal conductivity. Such bulk modified PDMS composite materials can be created by embedding free molecules (e.g., dyes), nanoparticles (graphene, carbon nanotubes, and various other of organic and inorganic nature) or microparticles, or by altering the composition of the prepolymers before polymerization.

Both, surface and bulk modifications of PDMS open avenues to a multitude of tuneable characteristics optimized for a diverse set of applications ranging from integrated micro- (lab-on-a-chip) to macro-systems (biomedical devices and epidermal electronics).

In microfluidic systems design exploiting modified PDMS, a key aspect of this review, the unique features of these materials permit rapid, easy, and reproducible construction without the need for elaborate facilities and trained personnel as compared to other materials like silicon.

This review focuses on recent progress in modification strategies to alter deliberately PDMS surface and bulk properties, especially for microfluidic, biological, flexible electronics, e-skin, and self-healing applications.},

@article{Wowk.2010,
 abstract = {Vitrification is a process in which a liquid begins to behave as a solid during cooling without any substantial change in molecular arrangement or thermodynamic state variables. The physical phenomenon of vitrification is relevant to both cryopreservation by freezing, in which cells survive in glass between ice crystals, and cryopreservation by vitrification in which a whole sample is vitrified. The change from liquid to solid behavior is called the glass transition. It is coincident with liquid viscosity reaching 10(13) Poise during cooling, which corresponds to a shear stress relaxation time of several minutes. The glass transition can be understood on a molecular level as a loss of rotational and translational degrees of freedom over a particular measurement timescale, leaving only bond vibration within a fixed molecular structure. Reduced freedom of molecular movement results in decreased heat capacity and thermal expansivity in glass relative to the liquid state. In cryoprotectant solutions, the change from liquid to solid properties happens over a approximately 10 degrees C temperature interval centered on a glass transition temperature, typically near -120 degrees C (+/-10 degrees C) for solutions used for vitrification. Loss of freedom to quickly rearrange molecular position causes liquids to depart from thermodynamic equilibrium as they turn into a glass during vitrification. Residual molecular mobility below the glass transition temperature allows glass to very slowly contract, release heat, and decrease entropy during relaxation toward equilibrium. Although diffusion is practically non-existent below the glass transition temperature, small local movements of molecules related to relaxation have consequences for cryobiology. In particular, ice nucleation in supercooled vitrification solutions occurs at remarkable speed until at least 15 degrees C below the glass transition temperature.},

@article{Wu.2015,
 abstract = {In the present study dynamic behavior of distilled water ice (polycrystalline ice Ih) is investigated under uniaxial compression at strain rates in the range of 100~s$-$~1 to 1350~s$-$~1 and at temperatures in the range of $-$~15~°C to $-$~173~°C using a modified split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The peak compressive strength is found to increase from 32~MPa to 112~MPa as the test temperatures are decreased from $-$~15~°C to $-$~125~°C. With a further decrease in test temperature from $-$~125~°C to $-$~173~°C the peak strength is observed to remain nearly constant and lie in the range of 110--120~MPa. In addition, the ice samples show positive strain rate sensitivity over the range of strain rates employed in the present tests at test temperatures in the range of $-$~15~°C to $-$~125~°C. However, the sensitivity of the logarithmic of peak stress (strength) to logarithmic of strain rate decreases with decreasing test temperatures, and the ice samples are observed to be nearly insensitive to strain rate at test temperatures lower than $-$~125~°C. An interesting feature of the dynamic compressive behavior of ice is the presence of a shoulder/double-peak in the dynamic stress versus strain curves at test temperatures in the range of $-$~50~°C to $-$~150~°C. Another feature of the post-peak stress regime of distilled water ice is the presence of a long tail in the dynamic stress versus strain curves at a test temperature of $-$~15~°C. At lower test temperatures (from $-$~150~°C to $-$~173~°C) the residual strength of ice is observed to become negligible. These artifacts in the dynamic behavior of ice can be attributed to details associated with dynamic failure of the ice samples and geometric effects emanating from the finite size of the samples and the diameter of the loading bars. The residual dynamic strength of ice can be best understood by considering the damaged/fragmented ice as an assemblage of wet highly-fragmented granular material created by adiabatic heating during grain-to-grain frictional sliding and held together by ice melt and/or recrystallization in the post peak-stress regime.},

 abstract = {Summary

As exemplified by the extreme cold weather hitting central China and causing great economic losses in 2018, as well as the 2021 Texas power crisis involving more than 4.5 million homes and businesses in the United States owing to frosting/icing, anti-frosting/anti-icing has been a long-standing challenge in modern society. Over the past decade, various approaches have been used to achieve anti-frosting, including active approaches and passive approaches. Given that active anti-frosting strategies are inefficient, energy consuming, and ponderous, tremendous progress has been made for passive anti-frosting strategies, owing to the booming of material engineering and the advanced measuring approaches. This review focuses on the process of condensation frosting, progress on passive anti-frosting, and prospects for this field. We aim to bring a comprehensive framework on passive anti-frosting in the broad sense: from inhibition of ice nucleation to reduction of frost/ice adhesion, from nanoscale to millimeter scale, and from surface design to material selection.},

 abstract = {Formation and accretion of ice on the leading edge surface of aircrafts wings may lead to disasters. The current de-icing system for aircraft will build up weight, increase energy consumption and add complexity to the aircraft systems. Development of icephobic coatings is a potential solution to prevent ice formation and/or reduce accretion on the critical surface of aircraft. Icephobic coatings based on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) with modification by fluorosilane and incorporation of silica nanoparticles have been fabricated. The hydrophobicity of the coatings has been measured in normal conditions with atmospheric pressure and room temperature, showing improvement of hydrophobicity by the fluorination of PDMS and incorporation of silica nanoparticles. The water droplet icing behaviour shows better anti-icing performance for fluorinated PDMS (F-PDMS)/silica coatings with a rough surface. The ice adhesion strength test results show that F-PDMS coatings without silica nanoparticles have lower ice adhesion strength implying better de-icing performance. The wettability of the coatings was also measured at reduced pressure and temperature, to study the mechanism of higher ice adhesion strength of F-PDMS/silica coatings comparing with F-PDMS based coatings. For the design and fabrication of icephobic coatings, compromise on the roughness induced hydrophobicity may become a critical requirement to avoid mechanical interlock between the ice and the rough surface.},

 abstract = {The structure, phase behavior, and properties of cellular membranes are derived from their composition, which includes phospholipids, sphingolipids, sterols, and proteins with various levels of glycosylation. Because of the intricate nature of cellular membranes, a plethora of in vitro studies have been carried out with model membrane systems that capture particular properties such as fluidity, permeability, and protein binding but vastly simplify the membrane composition in order to focus in detail on a specialized property or function. Supported lipid bilayers (SLB) are widely used as archetypes for cellular membranes, and this instructional review primarily focuses on the preparation and characterization of SLB systems formed by Langmuir deposition methods. Typical characterization methods, which take advantage of the planar orientation of SLBs, are illustrated, and references that go into more depth are included. This invited instructional review is written so that nonexperts can quickly gain in-depth knowledge regarding the preparation and characterization of SLBs. In addition, this work goes beyond traditional instructional reviews to provide expert readers with new results that cover a wider range of SLB systems than those previously reported in the literature. The quality of an SLB is frequently not well described, and details such as topological defects can influence the results and conclusions of an individual study. This article quantifies and compares the quality of SLBs fabricated from a variety of gel and fluid compositions, in correlation with preparation techniques and parameters, to generate general rules of thumb to guide the construction of designed SLB systems.},

 abstract = {Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) is a powerful method for uncovering the structure of soft nanostructured materials. The method is based on ultra-fast cooling and conversion of a liquid sample to a vitrified (glassy) specimen that can be examined in the TEM. Direct-imaging cryo-TEM discloses both the global supramolecular structure and local aggregate-specific details, at the hydrated state, and at a nanometer resolution. This placed the method as a central characterization tool in colloid, material, bio- and nano-related technologies in academia and industry. The advancement of cryo-TEM to new fields of research has been motivated also by significant improvements in instrumentation and software. In this review, we summarize the primary principles of cryo-TEM and highlight the recent contribution of this method to understanding soft-matter self-assembly. Detailed example address the origin of the viscosity peak in micellar solutions, and the nature of exotic assemblies as branched micelles, and micellar discs and ribbons. We further emphasize the strategic application of direct-imaging cryo-TEM to study fundamental biological processes and structure-function relations using the example of membrane-remodeling proteins involved in fission and fusion.},

@article{Glatz.2018,
 abstract = {Controlled surface wrinkling is widely applied for structuring surfaces in the micro- and nano-range. The formation of cracks in the wrinkling process is however limiting applications, and developing approaches towards crack-free wrinkles is therefore vital. To understand crack-formation, we systematically characterized the thickness and mechanics of thin layers formed by O2-plasma-oxidation of polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) as a function of plasma power and pressure using Atomic Force Microscopy Quantitative Nano-mechanical Mapping (AFM-QNM). We found a nearly constant layer thickness with simultaneously changing Young's moduli for both power and pressure screenings. We determined the respective crack densities, revealing conditions for crack-free wrinkling. Thus we could identify correlations between the intensity of plasma treatment and the cracking behavior. The primary cause for crack-suppression is a continuous elasticity gradient starting within the soft bulk PDMS, and rising up to several hundred MPa at the oxidized layer's surface. With mechanical simulations via the Finite Elements Method (FEM) we were able to demonstrate a noticeable difference in maximal stress intensity \textgreek{s}max between a comparable, but theoretical single layer and a gradient interface. A threshold in tensile stress of \textgreek{s}crit = 14 MPa distinguishes between intact and cracked layers.},

 abstract = {Preventing icing on exposed surfaces is important for life and technology. While suppressing ice nucleation by surface structuring and local confinement is highly desirable and yet to be achieved, a realistic roadmap of icephobicity is to live with ice, but with lowest possible ice adhesion. According to fracture mechanics, the key to lower ice adhesion is to maximize crack driving forces at the ice-substrate interface. Herein, we present a novel integrated macro-crack initiator mechanism combining nano-crack and micro-crack initiators, and demonstrate a new approach to designing super-low ice adhesion surfaces by introducing sub-structures into smooth polydimethylsiloxane coatings. Our design promotes the initiation of macro-cracks and enables the reduction of ice adhesion by at least $\sim$50{\%} regardless of the curing temperature, weight ratio and size of internal holes, reaching a lowest ice adhesion of 5.7 kPa. The multiscale crack initiator mechanisms provide an unprecedented and versatile strategy towards designing super-low ice adhesion surfaces.},

@article{He.2018,
 abstract = {The mitigation of ice on exposed surfaces is of great importance to many aspects of life. Ice accretion, however, is unavoidable as time elapses and temperature lowers sufficiently. One practical solution is to reduce the ice adhesion strength on a surface to as low as possible, by either decreasing the substrate elastic modulus, lowering surface energy or increasing the length of cracks at the ice-solid interface. Herein, we present a facile preparation of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based sandwich-like sponges with super-low ice adhesion. The weight ratio of the PDMS prepolymer to the curing agent is tuned to a lower surface energy and elastic modulus. The introduction of PDMS sponge structures combined the advantages of both a reduced apparent elastic modulus and most importantly, the macroscopic crack initiators at the ice-solid interface, resulting in dramatic reduction of the ice adhesion strength. Our design of sandwich-like sponges achieved a low ice adhesion strength as low as 0.9 kPa for pure PDMS materials without any additives. The super-low ice adhesion strength remains constant after 25 icing and deicing cycles. We thus provide a new and low-cost approach to realize durable super-low ice adhesion surfaces.},

In recent years dramatic enhancement of the level of detail at which a fluorescing structure of interest can be imaged have been achieved. We review classical and new developments in high-resolution microscopy, and describe how these methods have been used in biological research. Classical methods include widefield and confocal microscopy whereas novel approaches range from linear methods such as 4Pi, I(5) and structured illumination microscopy to non-linear schemes such as stimulated emission depletion and saturated structured illumination. Localization based approaches (e.g. PALM and STORM), near-field methods and total internal refraction microscopy are also discussed. As the terms 'resolution', 'sensitivity', 'sampling' and 'precision' are sometimes confused, we explain their clear distinction. Key concepts such as the point spread function and the Abbe limit, which are necessary for an in depth understanding of the presented methods, are described without requiring extensive mathematical training.},

@article{IbanezIbanez.2022,
 abstract = {HYPOTHESIS

Ice adhesion to rigid materials is reduced with low energy surfaces of high receding contact angles. However, their adhesion strength values are above the threshold value to be considered as icephobic materials. Surface deformability is a promising route to further reduce ice adhesion.

EXPERIMENTS

In this work, we prepared elastomer surfaces with a wide range of elastic moduli and hydrophobicity degree and we measured their ice adhesion strength. Moreover, we also explored the deicing performance of oil-infused elastomeric surfaces. The ice adhesion was characterized by two detachment modes: tensile and shear.

FINDINGS

The variety of elastomeric surfaces allowed us to simultaneously analyze the ice adhesion dependence with deformability and contact angle hysteresis. We found that the impact of these properties depends on the detachment mode, being deformability more important in shear mode and hydrophobicity more relevant in tensile mode. In addition, oil infusion further reduces ice adhesion due to the interfacial slippage. From an optimal balance between deformability and hydrophobicity, we were able to identify surfaces with super-low ice adhesion.},

@article{Faoro.2018b,
 abstract = {Cryogenic fluorescent light microscopy of flash-frozen cells stands out by artifact-free fixation and very little photobleaching of the fluorophores used. To attain the highest level of resolution, aberration-free immersion objectives with accurately matched immersion media are required, but both do not exist for imaging below the glass-transition temperature of water. Here, we resolve this challenge by combining a cryoimmersion medium, HFE-7200, which matches the refractive index of room-temperature water, with a technological concept in which the body of the objective and the front lens are not in thermal equilibrium. We implemented this concept by replacing the metallic front-lens mount of a standard bioimaging water immersion objective with an insulating ceramic mount heated around its perimeter. In this way, the objective metal housing can be maintained at room temperature, while creating a thermally shielded cold microenvironment around the sample and front lens. To demonstrate the range of potential applications, we show that our method can provide superior contrast in Escherichia coli and yeast cells expressing fluorescent proteins and resolve submicrometer structures in multicolor immunolabeled human bone osteosarcoma epithelial (U2OS) cells at [Formula: see text]C.},

 abstract = {Nanotechnology and nanoscience are enabled by nanofabrication. Electron-beam lithography, which makes 2D patterns down to a few nanometers, is one of the fundamental pillars of nanofabrication. Recently, significant progress in 3D electron-beam-based nanofabrication has been made, such as the emerging ice lithography technology, in which ice thin-films are patterned by a focused electron-beam. Here, we review the history and progress of ice lithography, and focus on its applications in efficient 3D nanofabrication and additive manufacturing or nanoscale 3D printing. The finest linewidth made using frozen octane is below 5 nm, and nanostructures can be fabricated in selected areas on non-planar surfaces such as freely suspended nanotubes or nanowires. As developing custom instruments is required to advance this emerging technology, we discuss the evolution of ice lithography instruments and highlight major instrumentation advances. Finally, we present the perspectives of 3D printing of functional materials using organic ices. We believe that we barely scratched the surface of this new and exciting research area, and we hope that this review will stimulate cutting-edge and interdisciplinary research that exploits the undiscovered potentials of ice lithography for 3D photonics, electronics and 3D nanodevices for biology and medicine.},
