\subsection{Methods for getting rid of ice xD}

There are four passive anti-frosing strategies: Inhibition of ice nucleation is archieved by using surface inherent properties and heating to prevent ice crystals to form. Retardation of frosting removes water over time to prevent icing on the surface with water repellent properties such as the lotus effect. Mitigation of frost accumulation prevents already formed ice droplets to further accumulate and forming an ice layer. Last a reduction of ice adhesion so ice needs less force to detach of a surface even until ice droplets are not able to attach to a surface, detaching themself with the force of gravity \cite{Yang.2021}. 

\subsection{PDMS application (in z.b. der Flugindustrie)}

\subsection{Assemblies used at cryogenic temperatures}

In advance, two specialized assemblies designed before this master thesis are used throughout the master thesis. These tools created for partially different purposes.

First a Bath for sample preparation is used

Second, an assembly to lift samples at cryogenic temperatures is used.
