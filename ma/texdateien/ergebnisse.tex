\section{Solubility lipids}

In the previous chapter, the method of using a sacrificial layer to detach ice is discussed. For this, lipids need to be solved at cryogenic temperatures. As not every lipid is dissoluble in all solvents, an experiment is conducted to obtain solvents at room temperature. Then the best solvents are tested at cryogenic temperatures.

The solubility of lipids at room temperature in different solvents are determined. For this experiment the cover glasses are coated with lipids. Then a first reference image was taken. Then the cover glass is given into a small container with the potential solvent. After 15 minutes, the cover glass is removed and compared under the microscope with the reference picture. If streaks created from lipids are still as visible as before, the lipids are categorized as insoluble in this solvent. If the streaks partially dissapeared and/or are less visible, the lipids are categorized as partially soluble in this solvent. Last if the streaks completely disappear, the lipids are assinged as soluble in the solvent (Table \ref{table:LoeslichkeitRaumtemperatur}).

	\label{table:LoeslichkeitRaumtemperatur}
\end{table}

This experiment shows that each three different solvent exist for EGG-PC and DOPC with high solubility (Table \ref{table:LoeslichkeitRaumtemperatur}). Following these results, solvents categorized with "soluble" are tested regarding solubility at temperatures of \SI{-140}{\degreeCelsius}. As not all solutions are liquid at \SI{-140}{\degreeCelsius} (Table \ref{table:SchmelztemperaturLösungsmittel}), they are tested at higher temperatures above their melting point, as mentioned in chapter \ref{chapter:meltingtemp}. In addition they are tested as mixtures with other solvents with a lower melting point. Additionally liquid ethane is tested as solvent. Ethane was not tested at room temperature, as the boiling point is at \SI{-88.6}{\degreeCelsius} \cite{PubChem.29.08.2023}.

In the experiment, no tested solvent was able to completely solve lipids at \SI{-140}{\degreeCelsius} and within \SI{15}{\minute} (Table \ref{table:Cryoloeslichkeit}). Also streaks of applied lipids did not only stay partially behind, but also new streaks appear on the glass slides. This means that some lipids redistributed on the same glass slide.

Using solvents to remove a sacrificial layer, a high solubility is required. In practice, the sacrificial layer is completely covered by the ice layer except the edges. Therefore area of contact with the solvent is small, slowing the process considerably. Additionally, as the ice layer needs to stay vitrified. The temperature cannot be raised over \SI{-140}{\degreeCelsius} to speed up the process.

The solving process of lipids proves to be endothermic. This means that heat is needed to solve lipids, so cold temperature heavily decrease solubility. This effect was observed over the last experiments by all solvents to varying degree. It can be assumed that the majority of solvent lipids mixtures are endothermic which is very disadvantageous for finding a potential solvent lipid candidate. Strongly exothermic solvents could heat up the ice enough to crystallize the ice. So weakly exothermic solvents would be optimal for this task.

\section{Separating the ice layer mechanically}
\label{Chapter:LipidPullingTests}

\subsection{PDMS experiments at room temperature}

To speed up the process of finding the right balance of PDMS Mixture ratio and plasma curing, experiments are done at room temperature. For this, a pulling machine is used. First the sample is prepared. Then, the sample is clamped to the pulling machine. Then a plexiglass stamp is aligned on top of the sample. With UV glue, the stamp is glued to the PDMS layer on the sample. Before gluing, The relative force and distance is set to zero on the pulling machine. After gluing, a couple minutes have to be waited, so no further stress changes are ongoing from the gluing process. After setting the force again to zero, the Machine is pulling on the sample with constant velocity. After detachment, the measurement is stopped. Afterwards, the stamp and the layer are analyzed under a microscope. The area of the attached UV glue to the sample is determined. With the maximum force and area, the maximum stress is calculated. Each experiment is repeated multiple times.

In between experiments, small variations and improvements are done: two different stamps are used, one has an area of \SI{2}{\milli\meter} x \SI{3}{\milli\meter} and another stamp is \SI{3}{\milli\meter} x \SI{3}{\milli\meter}. Since the area is measured by the attached surface to the sample, the effect of a bigger stamp is taken into account. Also, in first experiments, while waiting of the stress changes to subside, the pulling machine is holding the position. As the UV glue cools and shrinks while being polymerized, the UV glue pulls the stamp and the surface more and more together. Before pulling, the machine is set back to zero. After pulling, an offset exists between before pulling which is set to zero and after pulling when both ends are disconnected. The offset is then corrected in evaluation. To avoid calculating an offset, the pulling machine sets the distance corresponding to the forces being constant to zero. The offset correction and new method increased the accuracy between pull tests.

To verify the setup, cover glass coated with 4:1 and 1:2 curing agent to base coat weight ratio and uncoated cover glass as control surface are compared. The results show 2:1 mixture ratio with $87.3\pm19.9\,\si{\kilo\pascal}$ is easier to detach than 1:4 mixture ratio with $429.1\pm5.1\,\si{\kilo\pascal}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:vgl4:1zu1:2zuGlas}). Also the cover glass without PDMS takes up a lot more tensile stress up to $1161.5\pm111.5\,\si{\kilo\pascal}$. sometimes the machine is able to break the control cover glass. 

In literature, the ice adhesion on PDMS without plasma treatment is \SI{35}{\kilo\pascal}. for 2:1 and 5:1 the stress is between $60$ to \SI{80}{\kilo\pascal} \cite{IbanezIbanez.2022}. This is considerably lower than the experiment before. Therefore, one limitation is that the actual adhesion between ice and PDMS cannot be simulated by this experiment. Still, there is a correlation between values measured and in literature. Additionally, A detachment between other layers than the transition of ice and PDMS counts as successful detachment. 

\begin{figure}[hbt!]

	\caption{Comparison of PDMS with 4:1, 1:2 Base coat to curing Agent mixture ratio by weight coated on a cover glass and cover glass without PDMS as reference. the cover glass without pdms is clearly distinguishable by higher tensile stress. A mixture ratio of 1:2 shows the lowest tensile strength.}
	%TODO n hinzufügen
	\label{fig:vgl4:1zu1:2zuGlas}
\end{figure}

In the next experiment, the effect of plasma curing is investigated. A mixture ratio of 1:2 is examined as this mixture ratio leads to the lowest adhesion to ice and other surfaces. The same setup on the pulling machine is used. Samples with a 2:1 weight ratio PDMS are additionally plasma treated before quickly clamping on the pulling machine. The minimum plasma activation possible with used plasma machine is $25\%$ at \SI{0.1}{\minute}. Below $25\%$ plasma does not reliably form in the chamber. the maximum tested plasma activation of \SI{2}{\minute} by $100\%$ is additionally done with a bigger plasma machine.

After pulling, The UV glue is almost always firmly connected to the Stamp. In some cases, the UV glue is not connected to the Stamp. This suggest that the glue did not adhere well enough to the stamp. These attempts are sorted out. For the same reason, attempts where the cover glass cracked are sorted out as well. Additionally, cases in which the Tensile stress is near or within the uncertaincy of the control are sorted out as well. This can occur when the PDMS slide flips between loosening and fastening.

Even with low repetition rates of $n = 1$ to $ n =3$, a clear tendency is visible. With lower and stronger plasma treatment, the tensile stress needed to detach from the PDMS Layer is higher (Fig. \ref{fig:PlotPlasmaAktivierung}). Over the whole range, The tensile strength of PDMS becomes up to six times higher. This is not expected, as plasma activation on mixture ratios of 50:1 has the opposite effect \cite{Ohishi.2017}. This means that this the results are not applicable to other mixture ratios. also no visible changes to a glass-like state was observed in 2:1 weight ratio mixture. Because the repetition rate is low, the exact values should be treated with caution.

	\caption{Tensile strength of PDMS 2:1 mixture ratio coated cover glass with different plasma activation. For each data point, the repetition rate is $n = 1$ to $ n =3$. A clear tendency of an increase of tensile Stress over intensity of plasma activation is visible.}

	\label{fig:PlotPlasmaAktivierung}
\end{figure}

As PDMS is hydrophobic, plasma activation is needed to freeze a thin layer of ice onto the coated slide. However, super low plasma activation could not decrease the contact angle of water enough. To test the contact angle,  PDMS coated slides with mixture ratio 1:2 is plasma activated with $25\%$ for \SI{0.1}{\minute}, $30\%$ for \SI{0.2}{\minute} and $35\%$ or \SI{0.3}{\minute}. $25\%$ for \SI{0.1}{\minute} results in a contact angle around \SI{45}{\degree}. $25\%$ for \SI{0.2}{\minute} contact angle is around \SI{15}{\degree}. $35\%$ with \SI{0.3}{\minute} is below \SI{10}{\degree}. As a control, a PDMS coated cover glass with no treatment and a PDMS coated cover glass with UV treatment of \SI{3}{\minute} are compared. The untreated and UV treated PDMS coated glass have both a contact angle of over \SI{90}{\degree}. Both $25\%$ for \SI{0.2}{\minute} and $35\%$ with \SI{0.3}{\minute} are used in experiments.

Additonally, two other PDMS mixtures are used. 4:1 with \SI{10}{\minute} and $100\,\%$ plasma activation is used as reference. 50:1 mixture ratio is additionally used with different plasma activation duration. To verify the results of \cite{Ohishi.2017}, PDMS with 50:1 mixture treated with \SI{3}{\minute} at each $25\,\%$ and $100\,\%$ and \SI{10}{\minute} at $100\,\%$.

%\subsection{PDMS pull test at cryogenic temperatures}

%At cryogenic temperatures, three different mixture ratios are tested. 1:2 mixture ratio is used with minimal plasmaactivation, based on the result in previous chapter. 4:1 is used with 10 minutes 100\% plasma activation. 50:1 is used with 3 minutes plasmaactivation with 25\% and 100\%. additionally for 50:1, plasma activation for 10 minutes at 100\% is tested




%For this section, cover glass coated in Parylene are used as object slide. The slide is then dipped in solution containing lipids for a lipid coating. A ice layer with fluoriscine is frozen with either plunge-freezing or using a pincer and liquid nitrogen. Additionally, the "finger" is used as tool to try lifting off a piece of ice from the frozen layer on top of the lipids. In the next sections, different variables are examined and tested.

\subsection{Volume of Hydrofluorether}

First the volume of HFE is evaluated. High dosages of liquid HFE can spread underneath the frame holding the sample, leading to an inefficient force distribution. Also a thick glue layer take less tensile force, leading to a reduction of maximum force on the sample. Too little HFE will not connect the finger to the sample. Additionally, the dosaging of glue ia found to be a challenge.

The HFE is dosaged with a pipette onto the tip of the "finger". While pipetting, around \SI{4}{\micro\liter} of HFE is evaporating. Based on this knowledge, dosaging $4.10\,\mu l$, $4.30\,\mu l$ and $4.50\,\mu l$ is compared and a video is taken for later comparison.

The videos show that pipetting HFE is not reliable. The visible HFE volume on the tip does not correlate with the dosaged volume. On reason is a difference in the volume of HFE evaporating while applying. Also some HFE may be placed on the side of the tip. When using the finger, only the HFE on the flat tip is effective.

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Visual representation of the range of dosages which are the most reliable. less HFE than the lower limit is more likely to not attach to the sample properly. more HFE than the upper limit will spread under the "window" brace or results in a thick HFE layer with less tensile strength.}
	\label{fig:rangeHFE}
\end{figure}

Still, a visual estimate for the correct glue dosage is made by calculating the drop volume out of camera images. Two exemplary Pictures of an upper and lower limit of glue dosages is picked (Fig. \ref{fig:rangeHFE}). Then the volume is calculated with a formula for the volume of a spherical section. All needed components are calculated out of the estimated contact angle of the glue $\alpha \approx 45°$ and the tip diameter of $d = 1.68\,mm$. For the lower range a reduction of $d$ by a factor of $\frac{2}{3}$ is assumed as the drop is not covering the whole tip. The resulting volume range of the HFE is $ 0.11\,\mu l \gtrapprox V \gtrapprox 0.38\,\mu l $.

\subsection{Temperature over applied force}

The temperature dependent viscosity of HFE is used to attach and detach from the surface of the sample. With decreasing temperature, the viscosity of HFE increases. At some point, HFE forms cracks and gets brittle. To optimize the applied force at detaching, a temperature is needed which gives HFE high viscosity but does not form cracks at the same time. The determined temperature is then set for the "glue" state described before.

The viscosity and crack formation of HFE are tested. for this, HFE is given into a small temperature controlled bath. the temperatures -150°C, -155°C, -160°C, -165°C and -170°C are compared. Also changes in HFE when cooling and heating up are observed. A needle is put in the HFE to induce forces and subjectively test the viscosity of HFE at all temperatures.

At \SI{-150}{\degreeCelsius} to  \SI{-155}{\degreeCelsius} , the HFE is still only lightly viscous . the needle is not held up by the HFEs viscosity. At \SI{-160}{\degreeCelsius} to  \SI{-165}{\degreeCelsius} the HFE is viscous enough so that the Needle is hold up by the HFE. The Needle can be pulled out and the HFE is closing the gap. Also with enough force, the Needle can penetrate the HFE. also no cracks formed so far. At \SI{-170}{\degreeCelsius}, HFE hardens further. The HFE is still viscous. Wiggling the Needle in the HFE can result into cracks. Then the Needle can be easily pulled out. Under \SI{-170}{\degreeCelsius}, Cracks form without inducing forces in the HFE.

Heating the cracked HFE up leads to the cracks eventually disappearing. at \SI{-165}{\degreeCelsius}, first cracks disappear, but a many remain. The cracks left are still lowering the mechanical stability of the HFE. Heating up to \SI{-160}{\degreeCelsius} results in less cracks, but some still remain. A temperature of \SI{-150}{\degreeCelsius} will result in cracks completely disappearing.

At \SI{-165}{\degreeCelsius}, maximum load can be applied. Higher temperatures result in lower viscosity, which lowers the maximum stress before HFE breaks. At \SI{-170}{\degreeCelsius}, cracks will form, lowering the maximum stress.

To test how applicable the temperatures are with the "finger" setup, pulling tests are done as described in section \ref{Chapter:LipidPullingTests} except the temperatures of the finger is lowered to \SI{-165}{\degreeCelsius} and \SI{-170}{\degreeCelsius} in the "glue" state. With attention to proper insulation and no leakages of cold nitrogen gas, \SI{-165}{\degreeCelsius} is quickly reached and is held stable by temperature regulation over a time span of minutes. Still, the setup is not very reliable as new leaks can form and changing of tanks/tubings can lead to new leaks. These leaks are spotted only when the finger is already cooled. To fix leaks, the setup needs to warm up. \SI{-170}{\degreeCelsius} can sometimes be reached with the finger, but holding the temperature stable is not possible. 

When cooling down to the desired temperature with the "glue" state, liquid nitrogen is refilled to increase cooling. When refilling and cooling at the same time, rapid cooling happens when liquid nitrogen touches the shuttle directly at refilling. With this, the Temperature can shortly drop below \SI{-170}{\degreeCelsius}. This induces cracks in HFE, lowering the tensile strength. If this happens, the Sample and finger can be heaten up to the "unglue" state at \SI{-140}{\degreeCelsius} and the cracks disappear. Then cooling can start again.

In conclusion, the finger "glue" temperature is most effective at \SI{-165}{\degreeCelsius}. Still, the reliablility suffers trough leaks, longer tubing and inproper insulation. For better repetition, a temperature of \SI{-160}{\degreeCelsius} is also used in experiments.

\subsection{Applied Tensile force to HFE}

To additionally measure the force applied of the finger, the pulling machine is used in combination with the finger. In the lab, the small bath is used for sample preparation. after microscopy, the sample is transported to the pulling machine. the big bath is fixed on the bottom of the pulling machine. on top, the finger is clamped into the shackle and aligned to the shuttle. The process is still as previously stated. 

This setup has a lot of limitation. Aligning the finger is very difficult, as the screws are hard to reach in cold temperature. When cooling, the previous alignment ist lost as the coldness distort the setup. Also little movement at the finger has maximum effect on the sample and alignment. touching the tubes can loosen the sample and/or the setup needs to be new aligned. Even a bigger window is not enough. Errors in alignment and therefore gluing to the border of the window and loosening through movement are the two biggest error sources in this setup. So the old setup is used in further experiments to eliminate big error sources.

Over all pulls, the HFE can transfer a maximum force of $1.30\pm0.49\,\si{\newton}$. The exact size of the area which experienced the force is unknown. Additionally, the force distribution is uneven (e.g. like Fig. \ref{fig:ZeichnungBerechnungStress_c}). A worst case and a best case which are easily calculated can be determined. as best case, all force is evenly distributed under the area of the finger (Fig. \ref{fig:ZeichnungBerechnungStress_a}). With this assumption, the Area is equal to the finger tip area. The worst case is an even distribution over the whole surface (Fig. \ref{fig:ZeichnungBerechnungStress_b}). The surface is clamped by the window. So the inner diameter of the Window is the worst case area. In reality, the Force is somewhere in between (Table \ref{table:VerschAbschätzungenStressFinger}).

\subsection{Tensile mode vs Shear mode}

THIS NEEDS MORE LOVE

As mentioned before, Force can be applied by moving the stage in either X, Y or Z axis. In the tilted position of the harbor, moving in Z axis splits in mostly tensile mode but also shear mode.

Pulling tests are compared along the X and the Z axis. Generally, way less force is transferred when moving along the X axis. this is feelable with the resistance of the stage and hearable when the HFE detaches. 

\subsection{Detaching ice structure}

Different ice structures and thickness results in different stability of the ice layer. The freezing process has an influence on the formation of the ice structure. To compare plunge freezing by a plunge-freezer to the manual process, samples with lipid coated slides which are prepared with a plunge freezer are compared to samples frozen manually. The water applied to form the ice layer is mixed with fluoresceine. The fluoresceine to water ratio is $50\,\si{\milli\liter}/10\,\si{\milli\gram}$ and $5\,\si{\liter}/10\si{\milli\gram}$, depending on the microscope setup and objectives.

Manual freezing shows a less predictable shaped ice layer. Sometimes, a non continuous layer forms (Fig. \ref{fig:VglHandFreeze} (a) and (b)). In other iteration, a continuous layer is formed. (Fig. \ref{fig:VglHandFreeze} (c) and (d)). A plunge freezer reliably produces continuous layer (Fig. \ref{fig:VglMachineFreeze}). The thickness between samples varies. Some ice layers are thick enough to include air bubbles. Also, both hand-freezed and plunge-freezed samples ice layer have sometimes visible cracks.

To further compare both methods, 4 of each hand freezed and plunge freezed samples are compared regarding detachability. The "finger" is attached with HFE onto the sample. With movement up on the Z axis, the "finger" is inducing tensile force to the ice layer as an attempt to detach an ice piece. The results are categorized in 4 categories: Not successful pulls don't have visible changes of the flourescent ice layer, Partially successes are visible breaks or clear movement of ice parts on the ice layer, Successful liftoff is a missing piece and a visible piece on the finger, which could be used for future steps.

In the results, there is no difference between hand-freezed and plunge-freezed samples regarding detachability (Fig. \ref{table:AttemptsHandsvsMachine}). Therefore, using a plunge-freezer does not result in samples with favorable properties.

To compare PDMS coated slides to lipid coated slides, the same experiment is repeated for three different mixture ratios. Under the microscope, a continuous layer of ice is visible. \ref{fig:VglPDMSicemixtureratio}). The Ice layer has the same structure for each mixture ratio. Still, the ice layer has a different structure to ice frozen on lipid slides (fig \ref{fig:VglHandFreeze}, \ref{fig:VglMachineFreeze}). The layer is only interrupted by the imprint of pincers used for plunge freezing, visible in fig. \ref{fig:VglPDMSicemixtureratio_f}. Also almost no cracks are visible in the ice layer. This indicates a strong continuous ice layer.

In pulling tests with the finger the three PDMS mixture ratios are tested. For mixture ratio 1:2 and 50:1, all test are unsuccessful (fig. \ref{table:AttemptsPDMS}). however, at mixture ratio 4:1, a successful detachment was performed. However, the detachment cannot be confirmed as the before picture did not cover the area of the missing piece (fig. \ref{fig:SuccessfulDetachment}). without this proof, the formation of the hole when freezing cannot ruled out even if unlikely. Also a piece of ice is not distinguishable when hanging on the finger. Still, since a mixture ratio gave partial succesful results, this mixture ratio needs to be investigated further.

To test the behavior of an ice layer frozen onto PDMS, the surface is damaged in two ways. In one experiment, the Sample is scratched with a diamond pencil. This is done after mounting the sample on the shuttle. The diamond tip is drawn around the inside of the window several times, forming a visible groove (fig. \ref{fig:ScratchedSample}). In the other experiment, The pincer is intentionally placed through the middle of the sample when plunge-freezing. Therefore an intentional big imprint is left after freezing (fig. \ref{fig:PincerImprint}).

\subsection{observed error sources}

(AAH ABKLÄREN MIT SECTION IN METHODE: VIELLEICHT ALLES HIER REIN ODER VORNE)

When attaching, the right distance between sample and "finger" helps increasing the tensile force which can applied to the sample. As discussed in section \ref{section:positioning}, two types of positioning errors can occur: The positioning over the sample and the gap between sample and "finger". The first error can be corrected by stages in X and Y directions. The other error also depends on the HFE volume. With little volume, There is no risk of HFE spreading between sample an "window". With a high volume, Decreasing the gap can result in HFE spreading under the window brace if the "finger" is lowered too much. On the other hand, leaving a big gap between "finger" and sample results in a thicker HFE layer which takes less tensile forces.

The duration of time between reaching the "glue" state from the "unglue" state makes disconnecting before pulling more likely. The sample is cooled with the "finger" on top as well as by the harbor cooled with liquid nitrogen. Best case is the same cooling rate of "finger" and harbor. In practice, the cooling of the "finger" is faster. This also leads to successful attaching. If for example major leaks occur in the cold nitrogen gas supply, the cooling rate of the "finger" is slower than the harbor. In those cases, the "finger" does not stay attached to the sample. A theory is that HFE gets more viscous on the sample than on the "finger". While the HFE is perfectly adhering to the samples surface. Additionally, the HFE loses volume due to cooling. The HFE on the tip of the "finger" is able to fill out the missing volume and thin out around the finger due to gravity. With enough time, this could the HFE enough that the finger is not properly attached anymore. (NICHT SO DIE BESTE THEORIE; EIGENTLICH BEI GRO?ER LÜCKE?)

The formation of Ice inside the bath is largely inhibited through the Nitrogen Gas inlets. The nitrogen is forming a barrier to the atmosphere which contains humidity that turns into ice at cold temperatures. However, through turbulence and the finger, some ice can form inside the bath. 

In some experiments, high buildup of additional ice is observed on the sample. The additional ice is looser, reducing the possible grip onto the desired ice layer. The formation is traced back to a leakage in the finger. The tolerances between 3D printed part and metal bar should be able to seal the gap airtight. But trough changing out parts, the tolerances are looser, allowing a weak cold nitrogen current right on the sample. There are two possibility where the humidity itself is coming from: The cold nitrogen gas itself could contain some humidity. Second through additional turbulence, more air is sucked through the barrier. The air is directed directly on the sample, causing more ice buildup. To avoid this, the gap is sealed tight with twinsil dublicating silicone typically used for dental application.

\section{Inverted microscope}

The used microscope setup is a prototype based on an uninverted microscope. As using more inverted light microscopes are considered for usage in cryogenic temperature, the setup is analized and some common issues and possible fixes are proposed.

To take pictures, a two-fold and 5-fold objective is used. The 5-fold objective fits between the microscope and glasses assembly without a significant gap. However, to fit the 2-fold objective the glasses assembly needs to designed thinner. With the increased gap between objective and glasses assembly, more ambient light is lighting the sample. This decreased the visibility of fluorescence on samples. With the increased field of view with the 2-fold objective, total reflection of the two glass panes in the glasses assembly is inducing strong noise in the pictures. Also the access hole to the harbor is a bit too small.
To reduce noice and increase the harbor access, the glasses assembly is fixed tilted to the box by adding spacers. In future, the glasses assembly needs to be redesigned to fix all those issues.

In general, fitting the sample into the harbor is difficult. The cold gas is exhausted over the access to the harbor. The exhausted cold gas results in fog and locally reduces oxygen. The big stage and cooled box on top reduces visibility to the access point. In future, the exhaust should be pointed away from important access points.

Ice frozen to the assembly can also damage the microscope. Especially when the setup warms back up to room temperature, the ice melts and water drops onto important parts. Therefore, the objectives should be designed water proof. Gaps should be closed as much as possible to avoid water entering the inside of the microscope.
