To detach the ice layer from the sample holder, two main ideas are proposed: The first is using mechanical force to separate the ice layer. The second idea is designing a sacrificial layer which can be dissolved at cryogenic temperatures. In this chapter, the concept and procedure of each method is explained.

\section{Dissolving Phospholipids}

%TODO Etwas awkwarder absatz
Phospholipids are made of two long non-polar carbon chains and a polar head. A membrane is a bilayer of Phospholipids with the hydrophobic carbon chains oriented inwards and the hydrophilic head pointing outwards. They are also natural detergents, as they can bind to hydrophobic waste forming an emulsion, making them removable with polar liquids like water \cite{SriramaM.BhairiPh.D..2001}.

As Lipids are dissolvable at common solvents at room temperature, the idea is to use lipids as sacrificial layer at cryogenic temperatures. A solvent is used to dissolve the sacrificial lipid layer. To make this possible, a solvent with high solubility of lipids at cryogenic temperatures must be found. As the dissolving process is temperature dependent, solvents at room temperature are not necessarily solvents at cryogenic temperatures. Experiments are conducted to find a solvent to dissolve a lipid layer at cryogenic temperatures.

Parylene is a hydrophobic polymer used as a coating to repel particles, including water and ice. Parylene is also bio compatible and used in medicine and biology \cite{comelec.}. Parylene is not usable without a second layer on top. Parylene hydrophobicity does not allow water to spread during plunge freezing. With plasma activation, the surface is now hyrdophilic, but ice adheres to the parylene too strong for mechanical separation. %Parylene cannot be dissolved with a solvent as a sacrificial layer.

For this reason, lipids are used in combination with parylene (Fig. \ref{fig:sacrificial layer}). The hydrophobic chains of the lipids adhere to the parylene. The polar head allow water to spread evenly over the surface. Solving the lipids with a solvent will detach the ice layer from the sample holder. Parylene additionally prevents (re-) attachment through holes in the lipid layer.

\section{Separating the ice layer mechanically}

The other method discussed is to mechanically lift a part or the whole ice layer from the sample holder it is frozen to. The sample is frozen with plunge-freezing. For later steps the sample is prepared in a bath. The "finger" assembly is used to attach and pull on the ice layer. Hydrofluorether (HFE) temperature dependent viscosity is used to connect and pull onto the ice layer with the finger.

The goal is to vary the engineered layer do reduce the adhesion between ice and sample holder. The parylene and lipid coated samples are tested regarding being separable with the finger. Additionally, PDMS is used for its general low adhesion to ice. With different mixture ratios and plasma treatment, PDMS is tuned to be hydrophile at freezing and keeping low adhesion when separating. It is hydrophobic and has a low surface energy. It can be coat spinned into a thin layer on top of the sample holder. Also it is widely available and tunable. To use PDMS in plunge freezing, PDMS is plasma activated.

To create different PDMS mixtures, Dowsil Sylgard 184 Silicone elastomer is used\cite{DOW.}. In this master thesis, I focus on tuning PDMS by changing mixture ratio of base coat to curing agent to reduce adhesion of the ice layer to the sample holder. For tuning tensile testing is performed at room temperature to determine the effect of plasma activation and PDMS mixture ratio.

Tensile testing is done on PDMS coated cover glass pieces with a tensile testing machine. A stamp is glued on top of the PDMS layer with UV-glue. The stamp is pulled up by the tensile testing machine while the cover glass piece is clamped to the stationary bottom side. With the maximum force and area left behind by the UV-glue, the tensile stress is determined.

First, different mixture ratios and  a control uncoated cover glass is compared. Then, the effect of plasma curing is tested on PDMS at mixture ratios with low base coat portion. With these results, a mixture ratio with low adhesion is found to test at cryogenic temperatures. 

To test the effect of the engineered layer at cryogenic temperatures, a small bath filled with liquid nitrogen is placed below the finger. In the bath, samples are prepared. It additionally contains a harbor-shuttle system. The sample is fixed to the shuttle for transportation and fixation for tests with the finger. A warm nitrogen gas barrier keeps the finger tip and the content of the bath ice free by displacing humid air.

To try out the separating with the finger in a repeatable manner, following process is used: The sample is plunge-frozen with water mixed with fluoresceine or taken out of the storage and placed on the work surface in the bath. The sample is fixed to a copper shuttle. The now prepared shuttle is transported quickly to the microscope for pre-imaging. After microscopy, the sample is placed into the bath under the cooled finger. HFE is applied to the tip. The finger is lowered onto the sample in "unglue" mode. Lowering and correction of position is done with three stages until the HFE contacts and spreads over the sample. The temperature is reduced to "glue" temperature and waited until the sample and finger is cooled down. When the temperature is reached the finger is pulled up by turning one stage until detachment. Then the shuttle is transported to the microscope and the sample is analyzed.

When detachment is successful, the ice piece hanging on the finger is placed on another shuttle. This is done by lowering the finger onto a new sample holder fixed onto another shuttle and raising the Temperature to "unglue" mode.

The finger is also combined tensile testing machine. The finger is fixed to the top, while the bath is fixed to the bottom. The force at separation can be measured and quantified. The tensile strength of HFE can also be estimated. These results can be compared to data collected at pulling tests at room temperature and data in papers.

As the finger is used for this application for the first time, different variables are determined which could significantly influence successful detaching. With experiments, these variables are examined to improve the reliability of the finger. Following main variables are determined: The right volume of HFE on finger tip improves reliability. The temperature influences the strength of HFE. The right direction of force can make separation easier. Right positioning is important to induce forces efficient onto the right surfaces.
